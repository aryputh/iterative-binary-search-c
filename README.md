## iterative-binary-search-c

**Description**
<br>A chunk of code that shows an iterative binary search. This program starts from the first element and last element and compares the middle. Then, it checks which side the number is one (if it wasn't the middle number, and cuts the array accordingly. It then searches that half and breaks it again (if the target isn't the new number), and again until the number is found or not found. This program includes heavy commenting to help explain what is going on.

**Resources**
<br>This project was made in Microsoft Visual Studio.
